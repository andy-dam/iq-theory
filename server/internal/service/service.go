package service

// TODO: Implement your business logic layer
// This is where your core application logic lives
// Services coordinate between repositories and handlers

// Examples:
// - UserService (user management logic)
// - QuizService (quiz logic, scoring, etc.)
// - AuthService (authentication/authorization logic)

// Keep services focused on business rules, not HTTP or database details
